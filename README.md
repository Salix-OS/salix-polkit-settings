# About

This repository holds additional PolicyKit rules as used in Salix. These
files are typically installed under /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/ (which
is what the Makefile does by calling `make install`).

PolicyKit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the
policy that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged
processes. PolicyKit is specifically targeting applications in rich
desktop environments on multi-user UNIX-like operating systems.
